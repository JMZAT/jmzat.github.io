## What Is This Blog?
This blog serves to catalogue progress during my algorithmic trading activities. It will also keep me accountable, and I hope that you will comment with any corrections, ideas, or general thoughts.

## Is This Blog For Me?
Anyone who is interested in algorithmic trading is welcome. Whether you are a complete beginner or a seasoned quant, I aim to provide valuable insight and food for thought.

## What Papers Can I Find?
The papers section contains potentially useful academic research. I add papers periodically and review them to extract any valuable research. Please pay attention to each paper's tags. If the paper is tagged 'Unreviewed', I have only conducted a basic assesment of it's value.

## Will This Blog Make Me Rich?
NO, THIS BLOG IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. All information contained in this blog is solely for the purpose of documenting my progress, and MUST NOT be used as part of ANY investment decision. Trading - algorithmically or otherwise - carries tremendous risk and the large majority of retail participants lose up to 100% of their capital. Please consult a qualified financial advisor if you require any further clarification.
